## Test Phrases

Try translating these phrases using the real API:

- "Hello, how are you today?"
- "Welcome to our application"
- "Good morning, have a great day!"
- "The weather is beautiful today"
- "Thank you for using our service"

All translations are performed through the production API with support for 184+ languages.

## Demo Architecture

The demo application automatically detects the environment:

- **Development** (`bun run dev`): uses `http://localhost:8081/v1`
- **Production** (Netlify): uses `https://api.langie.uk/v1/`

This allows developers to test with a local API while users experience the production version.
